= Chip-8 emulator

This is an implementation of a Chip-8 "emulator".
(It's not really an emulator but rather a processor like interpreter for a limited set of machine code instructions.)

Nothing remarkable but a fun amusement during a weekend.

Although the Chip-8 "machine" or processor is very limited it can produce a lot of fun, 70's like, applications and games.

== Examples

Here are some examples of running games...

(It's not exciting game play but a rather short clip to show off the fantastic graphic abilities of a CHIP-8 virtual machine.)

== Disassembler

I made a disassembler to be able to find out what other programs were doing, just parsing the instructions of the ROM-files and printing actions in a more natural language.

(Well, the "ROM" is not really read-only as the program can self rewrite/mutate in memory during execution).

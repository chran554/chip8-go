= Chip-8 emulator

This is an implementation of a Chip-8 "emulator".
(It's not really an emulator but rather a processor like interpreter for a limited set of machine code instructions.)

Nothing remarkable but a fun amusement during a weekend.

Although the Chip-8 "machine" or processor is very limited it can produce a lot of fun, 70's like, applications and games.
